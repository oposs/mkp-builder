> **⚠️ Disclaimer**: This is an independent, community-developed tool and is **not officially affiliated with or endorsed by CheckMK GmbH**. This project was developed by reverse-engineering existing MKP package formats and studying CheckMK documentation. Any issues, bugs, or incompatibilities are our responsibility and should be reported to this project's issue tracker, not to CheckMK support.

> **📚 Plugin Development Guide**: Since many users of mkp-builder are developing CheckMK plugins, we maintain comprehensive documentation for CheckMK 2.3.x plugin development in [`cmk-pluigin-guide.md`](cmk-api-doc.md). This guide covers agent plugins, check plugins, rulesets, graphing, and bakery integration with practical examples and best practices.

> **🚨 Breaking Changes in v2.0.0**: If you're upgrading from v1.x, please note that v2.0.0 introduces breaking changes. The configuration file format has changed from `.mkp-builderrc` to `.mkp-builder.ini` with INI format syntax. GitHub Action input names have also been updated. See the [changelog](CHANGES.md) for full migration details.

A reusable GitHub Action for building CheckMK MKP (Monitoring Konfiguration Package) files from local directory structures.

## Features

- 🏗️ **Automated MKP Building**: Converts CheckMK plugin directory structures into installable MKP packages
- 🔧 **Configurable**: Supports all build options via inputs or configuration files
- 🐍 **Python Validation**: Optional syntax checking of Python files before packaging
- 📦 **Artifact Ready**: Outputs package information for easy artifact upload
- 🧹 **Clean**: No permanent changes to your repository
- ⚡ **Fast**: Downloads build tools on-demand, no bloated containers

## Quick Start

```yaml
- name: Build MKP Package
  uses: oposs/mkp-builder@v2
  with:
    version: '1.2.3'
```

## Version Pinning

For production use, choose the appropriate versioning strategy:

```yaml
# Pin to exact version (recommended for production)
- uses: oposs/mkp-builder@v2.0.0

# Pin to major version (gets latest features and fixes)  
- uses: oposs/mkp-builder@v2

# Use latest from main branch (not recommended for production)
- uses: oposs/mkp-builder@main
```

        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v2
        with:
          files: ${{ steps.build.outputs.package-file }}
          generate_release_notes: true
```

### Advanced Workflow with Validation

```yaml
name: Build and Test

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    tags: ['v*']
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Validate structure
        run: |
          if [[ ! -d "local" ]]; then
            echo "::error::Missing local/ directory"
            exit 1
          fi
      
      - name: Test build
        uses: oposs/mkp-builder@v2
        with:
          version: '0.0.0-test'
          validate-python: 'true'
          verbose: 'true'

  release:
    if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/v')
    needs: validate
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Extract version
        id: version
        run: echo "version=${GITHUB_REF#refs/tags/v}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
      
      - name: Build MKP
        id: build
        uses: oposs/mkp-builder@v2
        with:
          version: ${{ steps.version.outputs.version }}
      
      - name: Create Release
        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v2
        with:
          files: ${{ steps.build.outputs.package-file }}
```

## MKP Package Structure

The action creates MKP packages with the following structure:

```
package.mkp (tar file, gzip compressed)
├── info                    # Python dict with package metadata
├── info.json              # JSON version of metadata
├── agents.tar             # Agent plugins and scripts
├── cmk_addons_plugins.tar # CheckMK addon plugins
└── lib.tar                # Library files (bakery plugins)
```

## Supported CheckMK Versions

- **CheckMK 2.3.x** (default)

## File Mapping

The action automatically maps files from your local directory structure:

### Agent Files
- Source: `local/share/check_mk/agents/plugins/*`
- Target: `plugins/*` in agents.tar

### CMK Addons
- Source: `local/lib/python3/cmk_addons/plugins/PACKAGE_NAME/*`
- Target: `PACKAGE_NAME/*` in cmk_addons_plugins.tar

### Library Files
- Source: `local/lib/python3/cmk/base/cee/plugins/bakery/PACKAGE_NAME.py`
- Target: `cmk/base/cee/plugins/bakery/PACKAGE_NAME.py` in lib.tar

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No MKP file found after build"**
- Ensure your `local/` directory structure is correct
- Check that your `.mkp-builder.ini` file has valid syntax
- Verify Python files pass validation

**"Package name could not be determined"**
- Add `package-name` input or set `name` in the `[package]` section of `.mkp-builder.ini`
- Ensure your agent plugin files exist in the correct location

**"Python syntax error"**
- Fix Python syntax errors in your plugin files
- Or set `validate-python: 'false'` to skip validation

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose output for detailed logging:

```yaml
- uses: oposs/mkp-builder@v2
  with:
    version: '1.0.0'
    verbose: 'true'
```

### Manual Testing

You can test the build script locally:

```bash
# Download the script
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oposs/mkp-builder/main/mkp-builder.sh -o mkp-builder.sh
chmod +x mkp-builder.sh

# Run locally
./mkp-builder.sh --version 1.0.0 --verbose
```

## Version Pinning

For production use, pin to a specific version:

```yaml
# Pin to a specific version
- uses: oposs/mkp-builder@v2.0.0

# Pin to a major version (recommended)
- uses: oposs/mkp-builder@v2

# Use latest (not recommended for production)
- uses: oposs/mkp-builder@main
```
